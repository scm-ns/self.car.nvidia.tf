Impelment the End to End Learning for Self Driving Car challenge. (By Nvidia)
Currenlty just using tensorflow. 

The model will most probably be trained on game car driving video. 
Or it could be used for controlling the tachikoma.
	
	Objective: 
		> Train the network on game data and make predictions for the angle. 
		> After it, if I can get tachikoma working, then run the network there to guide motion.
